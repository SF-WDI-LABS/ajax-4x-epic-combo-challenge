<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/PqA0pxLLqhQju/giphy.gif" placeholder="combo-kick">

Four times together kicking API JSON and rapid turning website glory! Joining together with AJAX to display:

1. [What's your favorite movie?](/movie-poster) (Open Movie Database API)
2. [Should I walk or drive?](/walk-or-drive) (Weather Undergrond API)
3. [Can I share a bike?](/bike-me) (City Bikes API)
4. [Did everyone submit homework?](/github-homework) (Github API)

## Setup
Please clone this repo.

For each challenge:

1. Open the relevant `index.html` in your browser, and launch your Chrome Javascript Console.
    * Make sure you're working in the right folder!
2. Browse the API documentation and figure out what endpoint you need to hit.
3. Use jQuery's `ajax` method to fetch JSON from the API endpoint.
4. Process the results.
5. Render the page.

> We encourage you to work together and be creative! There is no *one* way to solve these challenges.
